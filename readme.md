# Nginx Lua programming demo using openresty

This demo contains a simple HTTP service for retrieving/storing data from a redis instance.

There's the same implementation by:
* nginx+php in port 8080
* nginx+lua (openresty) in port 8081

This demo was created for a presentation in [Web Dev & Sausages @ Tampere Vincit - 11.5.2017](http://www.webdevandsausages.org/).
